# Metaheuristic‑designer

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/metaheuristic-designer/badge/?version=latest)](https://metaheuristic-designer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**A modular, object‑oriented framework for building, testing, and analysing
population‑based optimisation algorithms.**  
Designed for researchers who demand **reproducible, composable, and
rigorously comparable** metaheuristics – and for practitioners who want
to get results quickly without sacrificing control.

The library is a direct implementation of the vision laid out in
[Metaheuristics “In the Large”](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.05.042).
Many design decisions follow the principles of
[Introduction to Evolutionary Computing](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-44874-8)
by Eiben and Smith.  For a deeper discussion of the philosophy behind the
framework, see the **Design Philosophy** page in the documentation.

## Installation

```bash
pip install metaheuristic-designer
```

To use the plotting examples, install the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install metaheuristic-designer[examples]
```

## Why metaheuristic‑designer?

- **Reproducibility by default** – Every component accepts a `random_state`
  (a NumPy Generator or a seed).  Passing the same seed guarantees
  identical runs, making your experiments truly reproducible.
- **Truly composable** – Algorithms are built by plugging together
  abstract interfaces (`Initializer`, `Encoding`, `Operator`,
  `ParentSelection`, `SurvivorSelection`, `SearchStrategy`).  Any piece
  can be swapped independently, enabling systematic exploration of
  algorithm design space.
- **Transparent and open** – The architecture hides no hidden mechanisms.
  Every operator, selection method, and schedule is explicitly configured,
  and the source code is designed to be read and extended.
- **Built‑in parameter scheduling** – Mutation strengths, probabilities,
  temperatures – any numeric parameter can follow a schedule that adapts
  during the search, giving you fine‑grained control over exploration
  vs. exploitation.
- **Rich analysis capabilities** – Track best, median, worst, full
  population fitness, diversity, and scheduled parameter values across
  generations.  The recorded data is easily exported to a pandas DataFrame
  for plotting with your favourite library (seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, …).
- **Safe checkpointing** – The algorithm can periodically save its entire
  state to disk.  If the process is interrupted (Ctrl+C, SIGTERM), the
  latest checkpoint is automatically preserved.  You can resume the run
  later without losing any progress.
- **Modular monitoring** – Choose between a silent run, a `tqdm` progress
  bar, or periodic text reports.  The reporting interface is extensible:
  you can write your own reporter to log custom metrics or integrate with
  external dashboards.
- **Research‑grade yet beginner‑friendly** – Start with the
  `metaheuristic_designer.simple` module for one‑line instantiation of
  common algorithms (GA, DE, PSO, SA, …).  When you need more control,
  dive into the object‑oriented configuration.

## Quick Start – minimise the Sphere function with a Genetic Algorithm

```python
import metaheuristic_designer as mhd
from metaheuristic_designer.benchmarks import Sphere
from metaheuristic_designer.strategies import GA
from metaheuristic_designer.initializers import UniformInitializer
from metaheuristic_designer.operators import create_operator
from metaheuristic_designer.parent_selection import create_parent_selection
from metaheuristic_designer.survivor_selection import create_survivor_selection
from metaheuristic_designer.algorithms import Algorithm

# 1. Define the problem (5‑dimensional, minimisation)
objfunc = Sphere(dimension=5, mode="min")

# 2. Create an initializer – random vectors between -10 and 10
rng = mhd.check_random_state(42)   # fix the random seed for reproducibility
init = UniformInitializer(objfunc.dimension, objfunc.lower_bound, objfunc.upper_bound,
                          pop_size=100, random_state=rng)

# 3. Build the operators (Gaussian mutation + uniform crossover)
mutation = create_operator("mutation.gaussian_mutation", F=0.1, N=1, random_state=rng)
crossover = create_operator("crossover.uniform", random_state=rng)

# 4. Selection methods
parent_sel = create_parent_selection("tournament", amount=50, tournament_size=3, random_state=rng)
survivor_sel = create_survivor_selection("elitism", amount=25, random_state=rng)

# 5. Assemble the search strategy (Genetic Algorithm)
strategy = GA(
    initializer=init,
    mutation_op=mutation,
    crossover_op=crossover,
    parent_sel=parent_sel,
    survivor_sel=survivor_sel,
    mutation_prob=0.3,
    crossover_prob=0.9,
    random_state=rng,
)

# 6. Run the algorithm for 200 generations
alg = Algorithm(
    objfunc, strategy,
    stop_cond="max_iterations",
    max_iterations=200,
    reporter="tqdm",
)
population = alg.optimize()

# 7. Inspect the result
solution, objective = population.best_solution()
print(f"Best objective: {objective:.6g}")
print(f"Decoded solution: {solution}")
```

More interactive examples are available in the `tutorials/` directory, and
executable scripts in the `examples/` directory demonstrate a wide range of
algorithms on classic optimisation tasks.

**Discover all built‑in components** – The complete catalogue of operators,
parent/survivor selection methods, encodings, initializers, and search
strategies – including all accepted parameters – is always up‑to‑date in the
online documentation.  You can also call `list_operators()`,
`list_parent_selection_methods()`, and `list_survivor_selection_methods()`
to print the registered keys directly from Python.

## Design Overview

The library is built around a small number of abstract, composable pieces.

### Algorithm
An `Algorithm` runs the optimisation loop — initialisation, stopping conditions,
progress tracking, and logging.  It can be configured with object‑oriented
components or with simple keyword arguments.

The `MemeticAlgorithm` subclass adds a local search step, implementing both
Baldwinian and Lamarckian memetic algorithms.

### Search Strategy
A `SearchStrategy` defines how the population evolves each generation.
It holds an initializer, an operator, and optionally parent/survivor selection.
Pre‑built strategies include:

- `HillClimb`, `LocalSearch`, `SA` (Simulated Annealing)
- `GA`, `ES`, `DE`, `PSO`
- `CrossEntropyMethod`, `GaussianUMDA`, `GaussianPBIL`, `BernoulliUMDA`, `BernoulliPBIL`, `CMA‑ES` (pending)
- `RandomSearch`
- `TabuSearch`, `IteratedLocalSearch` (coming in v1.1)

Custom strategies can be assembled directly with `SearchStrategy` or defined
from scratch.

### Operators
Operators modify the genotype of individuals.  They are created through a
**factory** that accepts a string key and optional parameters:

```python
create_operator("mutation.gaussian_mutation", F=0.2, N=3, random_state=42)
create_operator("crossover.one_point_crossover", random_state=42)
create_operator("de.best.1", F=0.8, Cr=0.9)
create_operator("permutation.swap", N=2)
```

A generic factory supports dot‑notation and runtime registration of custom
operators via `add_operator_entry`.  To see all available operator keys,
call `list_operators()`.

### Selection Methods
Two separate selection steps are distinguished:

- **Parent selection** – chooses which solutions will be used to generate
  new candidates.  Created via `create_parent_selection`.
- **Survivor selection** – decides which solutions survive to the next
  generation.  Created via `create_survivor_selection`.

Both factories accept a method name and optional parameters:

```python
create_parent_selection("tournament", amount=20, tournament_size=3)
create_survivor_selection("(m+n)")
create_survivor_selection("elitism", amount=5)
```

Available keys include `"best"`, `"random"`, `"roulette"`, `"sus"`,
`"one_to_one"`, `"prob_one_to_one"`, `"(m+n)"`, `"(m,n)"`, `"elitism"`,
`"cond_elitism"`, `"generational"`, and more.  To list all registered
methods, use `list_parent_selection_methods()` and
`list_survivor_selection_methods()`.

### Population
A `Population` stores a genotype matrix, fitness & objective values, the
best individual, and per‑spot historical bests.  Use `best_solution()` to
obtain the decoded best solution and its raw objective, and
`best_individual()` to get the genotype and its fitness value.

### Encodings
An `Encoding` translates between the internal genotype and the phenotype
evaluated by the objective function.  Built‑in encodings:

- `DefaultEncoding` (identity)
- `TypeCastEncoding` (float / int / bool)
- `MatrixEncoding` / `ImageEncoding`
- `SigmoidEncoding` (binary problems with continuous operators)
- `ParameterExtendingEncoding` — attach extra per‑individual parameters
  (velocity for PSO, sigma for self‑adaptation, …)

### Initializers
Initializers generate the starting population: `UniformInitializer`,
`GaussianInitializer`, `PermInitializer`, `SeedDetermInitializer`,
`SeedProbInitializer`, `DirectInitializer`, and `ExtendedInitializer`
(for parameter‑extending encodings).

### Benchmarks
A collection of test problems is included:

- Continuous — `Sphere`, `Rastrigin`, `Rosenbrock`, `Ackley`, `Griewank`,
  `Weierstrass`, etc.
- Binary — `MaxOnes`, `BinKnapsack`, `ThreeSAT`
- Permutation — `MaxClique`, `TSP`
- Image approximation — `ImgApprox`, `ImgEntropy`, `ImgStd`

### Constraint Handling
Constraint handlers implement repair or penalty strategies:
`ClipBoundConstraint`, `BounceBoundConstraint`, `CycleBoundConstraint`,
`CompositeConstraint`, and linear penalty methods.

### Parameter Scheduling
Any numeric parameter can be a **schedulable** value (e.g., a decay schedule).
The library provides `LinearSchedule`, `LogisticSchedule`, `StepSchedule`,
`RandomSchedule`, and `ThresholdSchedule`.  Callable values are evaluated
each generation; you can also access current values via `.get_params()` or
the `.params` attribute.

### Reporters
Reporters control what information is displayed during a run.  Three
implementations are provided out‑of‑the‑box:

- `TQDMReporter` – a progress bar (requires `tqdm`)
- `VerboseReporter` – periodic text summaries
- `SilentReporter` – no output

You can also create your own reporter by subclassing `Reporter` and
implementing `log_init`, `log_step`, and `log_end`.

### Checkpointer
Long‑running experiments can be protected with the built‑in `Checkpointer`:
- **Periodic saving** – The full algorithm state is automatically saved
  every *N* iterations or after a configurable time interval.
- **OS‑signal safety** – If the process receives a `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) or
  `SIGTERM` (e.g., from a batch scheduler), the current state is
  immediately dumped to disk before the program exits.  You can resume
  the interrupted run later with
  `checkpointer.load("checkpoint.pkl")` and continue as if nothing happened.
- **Tunable frequency** – Choose between iteration‑based or time‑based
  checkpoints, or use both simultaneously.

This makes metaheuristic‑designer suitable for expensive, long‑running
optimisation tasks on shared clusters or cloud instances where interruptions
are expected.

## Reproducibility and Scientific Rigour

- **Seeded randomness everywhere** – Every random component (initializers,
  operators, selection, even parameter schedules with randomness) is
  driven by a `random_state` that you can fix.  Use
  `mhd.check_random_state(42)` to get a managed `numpy.random.Generator`.

- **Deterministic experiments** – When you pass the same seed, the entire
  optimisation run, including the initial population, mutation steps, and
  selection events, is bit‑for‑bit identical.

- **Tracking for analysis** – The `HistoryTracker` records per‑generation
  statistics (best, median, worst, diversity, scheduled parameters, full
  fitness vector) into a pandas‑compatible DataFrame.  This lets you produce
  publication‑quality convergence plots, statistical comparisons, and
  parameter‑evolution analyses with tools like seaborn or matplotlib.

- **Algorithm comparison made easy** – The `AlgorithmSelection` and
  `StrategySelection` classes allow you to run multiple algorithms across
  multiple trials and automatically collect their histories, simplifying
  rigorous benchmarking.

- **Open‑source, MIT licensed** – Use it freely in your research, and
  contribute back if you extend it.

## Extending the Framework

All components inherit from abstract bases, making custom additions
straightforward:

- **Custom Operator** — use `OperatorVectorDef` (matrix‑level) or
  `OperatorFromLambda` (population‑level), then register with
  `add_operator_entry`.
- **Custom Selection** — subclass `ParentSelection` or `SurvivorSelection`,
  or use `*FromLambda` wrappers.
- **Custom Strategy** — subclass `SearchStrategy` and override the methods
  you need, or use `SearchStrategyFromLambda`.
- **Custom Encoding / Initializer / Constraint Handler** — implement the
  corresponding abstract class or use the `*FromLambda` wrappers.

The documentation includes a full guide on
**Extending the Framework with Custom Components**.

## Documentation

The **primary source** for exploring the library’s capabilities is the
online documentation at
[https://metaheuristic-designer.readthedocs.io](https://metaheuristic-designer.readthedocs.io).
It contains:

- A searchable, browsable API reference covering every class and method.
- **Full catalogues** of built‑in operators, selection methods, encodings,
  initializers, search strategies, and benchmarks, with parameter tables.
- Step‑by‑step tutorials (including custom components, parameter schedules,
  self‑adaptive ES, real‑time plotting, and reproducible benchmarking).
- A plotting guide with example visualizations for convergence, diversity,
  fitness distributions, and scheduled parameters.
- The design philosophy behind the library.

If you find yourself unsure which operator or selection method to use,
start there – the documentation is designed as a discovery tool as much
as a reference.
